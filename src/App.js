						Over the past four years ive been working my butt off
						trying to learn as many programming languages as possible
						only to find out am cheating myself, i don't wanna lie, i am familiar with
						 more that 6 programming languages, but tell you what, all that was just a waste of time.
						 until i come across this say <strong> "Jack of all trades, master none"</strong>
						 i went back to the drawing board and <strong>javascript was a way for me</strong>
